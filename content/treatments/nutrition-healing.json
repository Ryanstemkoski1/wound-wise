      "content": "Another very important aspect of wound management is nutrition. Proper nutrition and hydration are crucial for wound healing. When it comes to nutrition, think of your body as a construction site—it needs the right materials to build and repair tissues. A well-balanced diet provides these building blocks, helping your body heal properly.",

      "heading": "Calories: The Worker Bees",
      "content": "First and foremost, calories are incredibly important. Just getting a sufficient amount of energy (calories) in the form of food and drink is so important because those calories are the 'worker bees' of the construction crew.\n\nWithout energy, work at the wound bed construction site is slow and drags out over time. Your body needs adequate caloric intake to fuel all the complex healing processes happening at the cellular level."

      "heading": "Protein: The Building Blocks",
      "content": "Getting enough protein is key. Foods like lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and dairy products are rich in protein and provide the necessary amino acids that support tissue repair and regeneration.\n\nThink of protein as the building blocks that will fill in your wound and cover it closed. Including adequate protein in your diet helps your body rebuild damaged tissues, such as skin, muscles, and blood vessels.",
