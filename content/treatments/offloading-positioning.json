      "content": "While contamination and infection can be one of the biggest roadblocks to wound healing, wound offloading and body repositioning can be one of your best allies in trying to heal your wound.\n\nBy 'repositioning,' we mean redistributing your body weight on a regular basis to continuously redistribute pressure around your wound site. By 'offloading,' we mean using one or more pillows or using a body positioner like a cushioned wedge, donut, or padded booties to help take pressure off your wound.\n\nStudies show that proper offloading significantly improves wound healing outcomes.",

        "title": "Why Offloading Matters",
        "content": "When you have continuous pressure on an area of skin or on a wound, you can end up disrupting blood flow to that tissue, causing worsening tissue damage. Excessive pressure can have the same effect on diabetic, venous, and other wound types as well."

      "heading": "Repositioning in Bed",
      "content": "If you're someone confined to the bed for long periods of time, it's a good idea to change your body position every couple of hours. This schedule helps redistribute pressure more evenly across your body parts and reduces the risk of developing or worsening an ulcer.",
      "subsections": [
        {
          "heading": "The 2-Hour Rotation Schedule",
          "content": "For instance, you can start by lying on your back for two hours, then turn onto one side for another two hours, and then finally switch to the other side for the next two hours. Repeating this schedule throughout the day and night ensures no single pressure point bears continuous weight.\n\nThe idea is to alternate resting your body weight between one buttock or the other. This reduces direct pressure on the hip bones and tailbone where pressure injury is most likely."

        {
          "heading": "The 30-Degree Position",
          "content": "Often, fashioning pillows or ideally a body wedge (if you have one) can help you maintain a proper offloading position in bed with the hip bone approximately 30 degrees off the bed or chair you are in. This angle is optimal for pressure redistribution while remaining comfortable."

      "heading": "Sitting in a Chair",
      "content": "When it comes to sitting in a chair, it's best to limit the amount of time you spend in that position. Prolonged sitting can put pressure on certain areas and increase the injury risk for new and existing pressure ulcers.\n\nAs a general guideline, try to avoid sitting in the same position in the same chair for longer than one hour at a time. If possible, it's a good idea to take breaks and move around a bit before returning to a seated position.",

They are particularly useful for individuals who spend a lot of time in bed or who have limited mobility.\n\nHeel boots completely offload the heels by suspending them above the bed surface, allowing blood flow to return and preventing new injuries."

They help maintain proper body alignment and relieve pressure on specific areas.\n\nFor example, if you have a pressure wound on your lower back, using a wedge-shaped cushion for the bed or a donut-shaped cushion for your chair can relieve the pressure on that specific area when sitting or lying down."

          "heading": "Leg Elevators",
          "content": "These are foam or inflatable cushions that elevate your legs, helping to relieve pressure on the heels, calves, and lower back. They are especially beneficial for individuals with severe mobility limitations.\n\nLeg elevators also help with circulation by using gravity to reduce swelling and improve blood flow to the wound area."

      "content": "Among these tools, I highly recommend leg elevators and body wedges for individuals with severely limited mobility. Positioners provide excellent support to help treat and protect the more vulnerable areas like the feet, heels, sacrum, and back. They can significantly aid in the healing and prevention of wounds, so I cannot recommend them enough for my patients.",
      "callout": {
        "type": "example",
        "title": "Preventive Approach",
        "content": "I generally suggest that anyone with a chronic wound and any mobility limitations use some type of designated pillow, positioner, or offloading device. Even if you don't have a wound right now, using such devices as a preventive measure can help reduce the risk of developing pressure wounds in the future."

By addressing the issues of pressure on an affected area, we can improve blood circulation, minimize tissue damage, and help your wound heal most efficiently.\n\nIf you have any concerns or questions about offloading techniques, or need help with choosing the right device for you, speak with your healthcare provider to find the best solution for your particular needs."
