      "content": "Cleaning a chronic wound is crucial for its proper healing. Think of wound cleansing as giving your wound a spa session—it cleanses the tissues, removes debris, revitalizes tissues, and improves circulation to help prevent infection and optimize healing.\n\nBetween visits to your wound care provider, it is equally important to continue cleaning the wound. This means gently washing and refreshing the wound bed according to your wound care provider's instructions with every dressing change. Daily wound cleansing keeps the wound environment optimal for healing and allows you to monitor for any concerning changes.",

      "content": "Wound cleansers may contain soaps, specific enzymes, and sometimes emulsifiers—all of which are designed to help break down and remove dirt, debris, and bacteria from the wound bed. The right cleanser depends on your wound type, infection status, and the amount of debris present.\n\nYour wound care doctor will recommend the most appropriate cleanser for your specific wound. This isn't a one-size-fits-all decision—different wounds require different approaches."

While it may seem to 'clean' the wound, it actually damages the delicate healing tissue. Reserve for initial cleaning of acute injuries only.\n\n**How to use (if recommended):** Dilute 1:1 with water, use briefly only for initial cleaning, then switch to saline."

Assess the wound**\n• Look for signs of infection: redness, swelling, increased drainage, odor\n• Note the tissue at the wound's bottom—should be light red or pink, may appear lumpy or glossy\n• Observe any changes from previous dressing change\n\n**6. Clean the wound**\n• Wet gauze sponge or pad with saline solution or prescribed cleanser\n• Ensure it's damp but not dripping\n• Starting from the CENTER of the wound, gently clean in circular motions outward\n• Extend cleaning at least one inch beyond the wound's edge\n• **Critical: NEVER wipe from outer edges toward center**—this introduces bacteria INTO the wound\n\n**7. Clean any drainage**\n• Remove any liquid draining from the wound\n• Use fresh gauze for each wipe\n• Discard used gauze into plastic trash bag\n\n**8. Rinse if needed**\n• Use fresh gauze moistened with saline to rinse away any loosened debris\n• Remove anything not eliminated during initial cleaning\n\n**9. Pat dry**\n• Gently pat (don't rub) the skin surrounding the wound with soft, clean towel\n• Ensure area is thoroughly dry—moisture on surrounding skin can cause maceration\n• The wound bed itself should remain slightly moist (don't dry it)\n\n**10. Apply new dressing**\n• Follow your provider's instructions for specific dressing type\n• Secure appropriately\n\n**11.

Irrigation uses pressurized fluid to flush out the wound more thoroughly.\n\n**When irrigation is needed:**\n• Deep wounds or wounds with undermining/tunneling\n• Heavy contamination or debris\n• Thick, tenacious drainage\n• Wounds with pockets or irregular surfaces\n\n**Irrigation technique:**\n• Use 30-60cc syringe (without needle) or commercial irrigation system\n• Fill with saline or prescribed cleanser\n• Hold tip 2-3 inches from wound\n• Apply steady pressure to flush wound bed\n• Angle spray to get into pockets and crevices\n• Allow fluid to drain out (into basin or onto waterproof pad)\n• Continue until drainage runs clear\n\n**Safety note:** Your wound care provider will teach you proper irrigation technique if your wound requires it.

      "question": "Can I use tap water to clean my wound?",
      "answer": "This depends on your wound type and local water quality. For most superficial wounds in areas with clean, potable tap water, it's acceptable for brief rinsing. However, sterile saline is always safer and preferred for chronic wounds, deep wounds, or wounds at high infection risk. Some areas have water that contains bacteria or chemicals that could harm wound healing. When in doubt, ask your healthcare provider. Bottled or boiled water is a middle-ground option."
    },
    {
      "question": "My wound cleanser stings—is this normal?",
      "answer": "No. Proper wound cleansers should NOT sting or cause pain. Saline solution and hypochlorous acid are essentially painless. If your cleanser causes stinging, it may be too harsh (like hydrogen peroxide) or there may be infection present making the tissue more sensitive. Contact your wound care provider—you may need a gentler cleanser or evaluation for infection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I clean a wound that's very painful to touch?",
      "answer": "First, take pain medication 30-60 minutes before the dressing change so it's at peak effectiveness. Use gentle irrigation rather than wiping—this is less traumatic. Ensure your cleanser is body temperature (warm it slightly if refrigerated). Work slowly and communicate with whoever is helping. Take breaks if needed. If pain remains severe despite these measures, contact your provider—you may need a different pain management approach or the pain could indicate infection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I clean my wound in the shower?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, but ask your provider first. For some wounds, shower spray provides gentle irrigation and makes cleaning easier. However, other wounds (certain surgical wounds, wounds with grafts, very deep wounds) should not be exposed to shower water. If approved, use lukewarm water, let it flow over the wound without direct hard spray, and pat dry afterward. Never use bath water (sitting in dirty water)—shower only."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my cleaning technique is making the wound worse?",
      "answer": "Warning signs include: increasing wound size, increasing pain during or after cleaning, increased redness around wound edges, new drainage or change in drainage color/odor, tissue that looks damaged or more yellow/black rather than pink/red. If you notice any of these, stop your current technique and contact your healthcare provider. You may be using too harsh a cleanser, too much pressure, or the wrong technique for your wound type."
