      "content": "Burn wounds are injuries to the skin and underlying tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. The severity of a burn depends on how deep it penetrates the skin layers and how much body surface area is affected.\n\nWhile minor burns often heal quickly with simple home care, more serious burns can become chronic wounds requiring specialized treatment. Understanding the type and severity of your burn is the first step in proper care and recovery.",

      "heading": "Why Burns Can Become Chronic Wounds",
      "content": "While minor first-degree burns heal quickly, second and third-degree burns can develop into chronic wounds due to several factors:\n\n• **Infection**: Burn wounds have a high infection risk due to loss of the skin's protective barrier and the moist, protein-rich environment that attracts bacteria\n\n• **Poor blood supply**: Deep burns damage blood vessels, reducing oxygen and nutrient delivery needed for healing\n\n• **Compromised healing**: Conditions like diabetes, poor nutrition, or smoking can significantly slow burn wound healing\n\n• **Scar contracture**: As burns heal, scar tissue can tighten and restrict movement, especially over joints\n\n• **Depth of injury**: Third-degree burns destroy the skin's regenerative capacity and require surgical intervention",

        "type": "info",
        "title": "The Healing Challenge",
        "content": "Unlike other wounds that heal from the edges inward, deep burns must often heal through skin grafting because the body's skin-regenerating cells have been destroyed. This is why third-degree burns cannot close on their own and require surgical intervention."

      "heading": "Immediate First Aid for Burns",
      "content": "Proper first aid can significantly impact healing outcomes for minor to moderate burns:\n\n**1. Stop the burning process**\n• Remove the person from the heat source\n• For chemical burns, brush off dry chemicals first, then rinse with water\n• Remove jewelry, belts, tight clothing before swelling begins\n\n**2. Cool the burn**\n• Run cool (not cold) water over the burn for 10-20 minutes\n• Do NOT use ice—this can cause further damage\n• Do NOT apply butter, oils, or home remedies\n\n**3. Cover the burn**\n• Use a sterile, non-stick bandage or clean cloth\n• Do NOT pop blisters\n• Loosely wrap to avoid pressure\n\n**4. Manage pain**\n• Over-the-counter pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen)\n• Elevate burned area above heart level if possible\n\n**5. Seek medical care**\n• For any serious burns or burns on sensitive areas\n• If burn covers a large area\n• For all chemical and electrical burns"

    {
      "heading": "Professional Treatment for Serious Burns",
      "content": "Second and third-degree burns require professional medical care:\n\n• **Wound assessment**: Healthcare providers determine burn depth and extent using standardized assessment tools\n\n• **Debridement**: Removal of dead tissue and ruptured blisters to prevent infection and promote healing\n\n• **Specialized dressings**: Burns require specific moisture-retaining and antimicrobial dressings that protect while promoting healing\n\n• **Topical antimicrobials**: Silver-based products (like silver sulfadiazine) help prevent infection\n\n• **Skin grafting**: For third-degree burns, surgical placement of healthy skin from another body area\n\n• **Physical therapy**: Essential for burns over joints to prevent contractures and maintain range of motion\n\n• **Pain management**: Burns are extremely painful and require comprehensive pain control strategies\n\n• **Nutritional support**: Burn healing requires significant protein and calories—sometimes 2-3 times normal needs"

Signs of infection include:\n\n• Increasing pain, redness, or swelling\n• Pus or cloudy drainage\n• Foul odor\n• Fever or chills\n• Red streaks extending from the wound\n• Wound edges that are pulling apart\n\n**Prevention strategies:**\n• Strict hand hygiene before wound care\n• Gentle cleansing with prescribed solutions\n• Using prescribed antimicrobial ointments\n• Changing dressings as directed\n• Keeping the wound covered and protected\n• Maintaining good overall hygiene\n• Adequate protein and vitamin intake to support immune function"

The healing journey may include:\n\n• **Psychological support**: Burns can be traumatic; counseling helps with anxiety, depression, and body image concerns\n• **Occupational therapy**: Helps regain functional abilities for daily activities\n• **Reconstructive surgery**: May be needed months or years later to improve function or appearance\n• **Pain management**: Some patients experience chronic pain even after wounds heal\n• **Skin care routine**: Healed burn skin requires lifelong moisturizing and sun protection\n• **Regular follow-up**: Ongoing monitoring for late complications like scar contracture or skin cancer in burn scars"

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Should I pop the blisters on my burn?",
      "answer": "No. Do not pop blisters. Intact blisters provide a natural, sterile barrier that protects the underlying tissue from infection and helps with healing. Popping blisters increases infection risk and can lead to complications. If a blister breaks on its own, gently clean it with mild soap and water, apply antibiotic ointment, and cover with a sterile bandage. See a healthcare provider for large or multiple blisters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesn't the center of my deep burn hurt, but the edges are excruciating?",
      "answer": "Third-degree burns destroy nerve endings in the center of the burn, so that area may feel numb. However, the edges of the burn typically have second-degree damage where nerve endings are still intact and highly sensitized, causing severe pain. This paradoxical lack of pain in the center is actually a sign of a more serious burn requiring immediate medical attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take for a burn to heal?",
      "answer": "Healing time depends on burn depth: First-degree burns heal in 3-6 days, superficial second-degree burns in 2-3 weeks, deep second-degree burns in 3-8 weeks. Third-degree burns cannot heal on their own and require skin grafting. Healing time also depends on burn size, location, your overall health, age, and whether complications like infection occur."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my burn scar?",
      "answer": "First-degree burns typically don't scar. Superficial second-degree burns may leave minimal scarring. Deep second-degree and all third-degree burns will scar. Scar severity depends on burn depth, size, location, your genetics, age, and how well you follow scar prevention strategies (pressure garments, silicone sheeting, physical therapy). Early intervention significantly improves scar outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can burns get infected even with proper care?",
      "answer": "Yes. Burns have high infection risk because the protective skin barrier is destroyed, creating an entry point for bacteria. Even with excellent care, infections can occur. Watch for warning signs: increasing pain, redness spreading beyond the burn, pus or cloudy drainage, foul odor, fever, or red streaks. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you suspect infection—early treatment is critical."
