      "heading": "What Are Pressure Injuries?",
      "content": "Pressure injuries occur when excessive pressure is applied to a specific area for too long, cutting off blood flow to the skin and underlying tissues. Without adequate blood supply, the tissue becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, leading to damage and potentially an open wound.",

        "title": "Dr. May's Analogy",
        "content": "Think of sitting on a hard bench during a long sporting event. The soreness you feel afterward is a mild form of pressure injury. Your body was telling you to shift positions, but imagine if you couldn't move for hours or days - that's when serious damage occurs."

    {
      "heading": "Common Pressure Points",
      "content": "Pressure injuries most commonly develop over bony prominences where there's less natural cushioning between bone and skin. The most vulnerable areas include:\n\n• Heels - one of the most common sites\n• Sacrum and coccyx (tailbone area)\n• Hips and sides of the pelvis\n• Shoulder blades\n• Back of the head (less common but possible)\n• Elbows and ankles\n\nThese areas are at highest risk because they bear the most pressure when lying down or sitting for extended periods.",

          "content": "The skin appears red or discolored but remains intact. When you press on the area, the redness doesn't fade (non-blanchable). The area may feel warm, firm, or soft compared to surrounding tissue. This is the earliest warning sign.",

      "heading": "Nutrition: Fueling the Healing Process",

Your body needs adequate calories, protein, and specific nutrients to repair damaged tissue.\n\nKey nutritional considerations:\n\n• Protein: The building blocks for new tissue formation. Aim for lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and dairy products.\n\n• Calories: Sufficient energy to power the healing process. Think of calories as the 'worker bees' of your body's construction crew.\n\n• Vitamin C: Essential for collagen synthesis. Found in citrus fruits, strawberries, and leafy greens.\n\n• Vitamin A: Promotes new cell growth. Found in carrots, sweet potatoes, and spinach.\n\n• Zinc: Vital for cell division and wound closure. Present in seafood, nuts, and whole grains.\n\n• Hydration: Proper water intake supports blood circulation and nutrient delivery to the wound site.",

Your wound care provider will select dressings based on the wound's depth, drainage level, and tissue type.\n\nCommon dressing types include:\n\n• Hydrocolloid dressings for shallow wounds with minimal drainage\n• Foam dressings for moderate to heavy drainage\n• Alginate dressings for highly draining wounds\n• Hydrogel dressings for dry wounds needing moisture\n• Transparent films for stage 1 injuries and protection\n• Antimicrobial dressings when infection is a concern\n\nNever attempt to stage or select dressings on your own.

Watch for these signs:\n\n• Increased pain, redness, or warmth around the wound\n• Pus or cloudy drainage\n• Foul odor\n• Fever or chills\n• Wound edges that appear dark or blackened\n• Red streaks extending from the wound\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Infections in pressure injuries can spread to bone (osteomyelitis) or bloodstream (sepsis) if left untreated.",

If you or a loved one has limited mobility:\n\n• Inspect skin daily, especially over bony areas\n• Maintain a repositioning schedule\n• Keep skin clean and dry\n• Address incontinence promptly\n• Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration\n• Use appropriate pressure-redistribution surfaces\n• Seek medical attention at the first sign of skin changes\n\nRemember, pressure injuries are largely preventable with proper care and attention."

    {
      "question": "How long does it take for a pressure injury to heal?",
      "answer": "Healing time varies greatly depending on the stage and overall health. Stage 1 injuries may resolve in days to weeks with proper care. Stage 3-4 injuries can take months. Factors affecting healing include nutrition, blood flow, infection control, and consistent pressure relief.",

    {
      "question": "Can pressure injuries heal on their own?",
      "answer": "Early-stage pressure injuries (Stage 1) may heal on their own if pressure is immediately relieved and proper care is provided. However, Stage 2 and deeper injuries typically require medical intervention, appropriate wound care, and often professional treatment to heal properly.",
      "category": "treatment"

    {
      "question": "Are pressure injuries only a problem for bedridden people?",
      "answer": "No. While pressure injuries are most common in immobile or bedridden individuals, they can also develop in wheelchair users, people with reduced sensation (such as from diabetes or spinal cord injury), or anyone who maintains prolonged pressure on bony areas without repositioning.",
      "category": "prevention"
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a pressure injury and a diabetic ulcer?",
      "answer": "Pressure injuries result from sustained pressure cutting off blood flow, typically over bony areas. Diabetic ulcers usually occur on the feet due to nerve damage (neuropathy) and poor circulation related to diabetes. However, people with diabetes can also develop pressure injuries, making proper assessment essential.",

    {
      "question": "Can I shower or bathe with a pressure injury?",
      "answer": "This depends on the wound stage and your healthcare provider's recommendations. Generally, brief showers are acceptable for most pressure injuries, but avoid prolonged water exposure. Pat the area dry thoroughly and reapply dressings as directed. Never soak in a bathtub with an open wound without medical guidance.",
