      "heading": "What Are Skin Tears?",
      "content": "A skin tear is a traumatic wound characterized by the separation of the top layer of skin (epidermis) from the underlying tissue (dermis). Think of it like tissue paper that rips when handled roughly—except it's your skin.\n\nSkin tears typically occur from friction, shear, or blunt trauma during everyday activities. They're particularly common in older adults whose skin has become thin and fragile due to aging, sun damage, or certain medications. While they may seem minor, skin tears can develop into serious chronic wounds if not properly treated, especially in people with diabetes, poor circulation, or compromised immune systems.",

      "heading": "Why Skin Becomes Fragile with Age",
      "content": "Understanding why skin becomes more vulnerable helps with prevention:\n\n• **Thinning of skin layers**: As we age, both epidermis and dermis become thinner, like fabric that's worn thin\n• **Loss of collagen**: Collagen provides skin strength and elasticity; production decreases significantly with age\n• **Reduced moisture**: Older skin produces less natural oil, becoming drier and more prone to cracking\n• **Sun damage accumulation**: Years of UV exposure breaks down collagen and elastin\n• **Decreased fat padding**: Loss of subcutaneous fat removes cushioning that protects against trauma\n• **Medication effects**: Blood thinners, steroids, and many common medications thin skin further\n• **Poor circulation**: Reduced blood flow means skin receives less nutrients for maintenance and repair",

Control bleeding**\n• Apply gentle pressure with clean gauze or cloth\n• DO NOT press too hard—this can damage fragile tissue further\n• Elevate the area if possible\n\n**3. Clean gently**\n• Use lukewarm water or normal saline solution\n• Pat (don't rub) the area clean\n• DO NOT use alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or harsh antiseptics—these damage delicate tissue\n\n**4. Reposition the skin flap (if present)**\n• Very gently smooth the skin flap back over the wound\n• Use sterile cotton swabs or clean gloved fingers\n• Position edges as close to normal anatomy as possible\n\n**5. Apply appropriate dressing**\n• Use non-adherent dressing that won't stick and cause further trauma during changes\n• Secure with gentle paper tape or wrap—NO aggressive adhesives\n• Ensure dressing is snug but not tight\n\n**6.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "My mother's skin tears so easily. Is this normal with aging?",
      "answer": "Yes, skin naturally becomes thinner and more fragile with age due to collagen loss, reduced moisture, and decreased fat padding. However, some skin tears ARE preventable. Daily moisturizing, protective clothing, environmental modifications (padding sharp edges), gentle handling techniques, and proper nutrition can significantly reduce skin tear frequency. Also review medications with your doctor—some thin skin further."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I remove the skin flap if it looks dead?",
      "answer": "No. Never remove a skin flap yourself, even if it looks questionable. What appears 'dead' may actually reattach and heal if handled properly. Healthcare providers are trained to assess flap viability. Removing it yourself eliminates the possibility of healing and guarantees a larger, more difficult wound. Gently clean and cover the area, then seek professional assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do skin tears take to heal?",
      "answer": "Healing time depends on the type and individual factors. Type 1 tears (flap intact): typically 1-3 weeks. Type 2 tears (partial loss): 2-4 weeks. Type 3 tears (complete loss): 3-6+ weeks. Factors affecting healing include age, nutrition, diabetes, medications (especially blood thinners and steroids), circulation, and how well prevention strategies prevent re-injury."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best moisturizer for preventing skin tears?",
      "answer": "Thick, fragrance-free creams or ointments work best. Look for products containing ceramides, hyaluronic acid, or dimethicone. Good options include CeraVe, Cetaphil, Eucerin, and Aquaphor. Apply at least twice daily, and especially within 3 minutes after bathing while skin is damp to lock in moisture. For very dry skin, consider petrolatum-based ointments (like Vaseline) at bedtime. Consistency matters more than brand—find one you like and use it daily."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can someone on blood thinners safely have skin tears treated?",
      "answer": "Yes, but extra caution is needed. Blood thinners make bleeding harder to control and may require longer gentle pressure to stop. The tear may also heal more slowly. DO NOT stop blood thinners without doctor approval—these medications prevent life-threatening blood clots. Instead, focus on prevention: rigorous skin care, protective clothing/padding, gentle handling. Notify your healthcare provider of any skin tear so they can monitor healing and adjust care as needed."
