Sometimes a wound may reopen unexpectedly, causing what we call a 'non-healing surgical wound' or a 'wound dehiscence.' There may be a number of reasons why something like this happens. I know it sounds scary, but I see occurrences like this every day, and they are often quite treatable. Let's dive right into those reasons.",

      "heading": "Tension on the Surgical Scar",
      "content": "One common reason for a surgical wound separating (or dehiscing) is tension along the surgical scar. Surgical scars overlying joints or on load-bearing areas of the body could be at a higher risk of unexpectedly reopening.\n\nExamples of such surgical sites might be incisions over the knee or ankle joints or incisions on the foot or buttock. For better or worse, pain at the surgical site can actually help to limit the movement or use of these body parts to give them time to heal.",

          "heading": "How Swelling Increases Tension",
          "content": "If there happens to be a lot of soft tissue swelling underneath an incision, this can also put a stretch on the skin that may increase the risk of wound separation. Think of the skin over a swollen area like a balloon being inflated—the more swelling, the more tension on the overlying skin.\n\nIn certain situations, your surgeon might choose to use a splint or a cast to help reduce tension when the surgery is in or around a joint, or they may instruct you to use ice or a compression wrap to keep swelling down at the surgical site.",

Using pillows or specialized body positioners under or around the surgical site can reduce or completely relieve unwanted pressure on the wound edges."

      "heading": "Poor Blood Supply to the Surgical Site",
      "content": "Sometimes, when wounds have a hard time healing, it can be due to a less than ideal blood supply to the surgical site. This is particularly true in the case of surgeries occurring in areas affected by poor circulation.\n\nConditions like arterial disease and diabetes can wreak havoc on wound healing. When surgery is performed in an area affected by circulation problems, the tissues already have a poor blood flow environment. Then, on top of this, when a surgeon has to cut through tissues (including blood vessels), it further destroys some of the blood flow to the area.",

          "content": "Your body needs building blocks to repair surgical wounds. Without adequate nutrition, healing cannot occur optimally, regardless of how well other aspects of care are managed.\n\n**Protein**: The most critical nutrient for wound healing. Aim for 1.25-1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily when healing surgical wounds. Include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and legumes.\n\n**Vitamin C**: Essential for collagen synthesis. Include citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, and leafy greens.\n\n**Vitamin A**: Supports cell growth and immune function. Found in carrots, sweet potatoes, and spinach.\n\n**Zinc**: Plays a vital role in cell division and wound closure. Present in seafood, nuts, and whole grains.\n\n**Hydration**: Water transports nutrients to tissues and removes waste products. Aim for adequate fluid intake unless restricted by medical conditions.\n\nIf you're malnourished or have difficulty eating, discuss protein supplementation with your healthcare provider. Sometimes liquid protein supplements are necessary to meet increased needs during healing."

Even if you can't quit long-term, abstaining during the peri-operative period significantly improves outcomes.\n\nNicotine replacement (patches, gum) is less harmful than smoking but still impairs healing.

    {
      "question": "Is it normal for my surgical incision to drain fluid?",
      "answer": "Some drainage is normal in the first few days after surgery—typically clear to slightly bloody fluid. However, excessive drainage, thick yellow or green pus, or foul-smelling discharge is not normal and indicates infection. Also, drainage that continues beyond the first week or increases rather than decreases should be reported to your surgeon. When in doubt, contact your surgeon's office to describe the drainage—they can advise whether it's normal or concerning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I keep my incision covered?",
      "answer": "This varies by surgery type and surgeon preference. Many incisions are kept covered with a dressing for 24-48 hours, then can be left open to air if they're clean, dry, and approximated (edges together). Some surgeries require dressings for longer periods. Follow your specific surgeon's instructions. If your incision is draining, has sutures or staples, or is in an area prone to friction or contamination, it should remain covered until your surgeon advises otherwise."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I shower after surgery?",
      "answer": "Timing varies by procedure. Many surgeons allow showering after 24-48 hours, but you should keep the incision dry during that shower (using plastic wrap or waterproof dressing). Some allow gentle water over the incision after a few days. Submersion in bathtubs, pools, or hot tubs is typically prohibited until incisions are fully healed and cleared by your surgeon—usually at least 2-3 weeks, often longer. Submersion significantly increases infection risk. Always follow your surgeon's specific instructions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my incision opens up?",
      "answer": "Contact your surgeon immediately. Small areas of superficial separation may be managed with local wound care and dressings. Larger or deeper dehiscence may require surgical revision and reclosure. In some cases, wounds are allowed to heal by secondary intention (from bottom up) if reclosure isn't appropriate. The treatment depends on the extent of separation, presence of infection, and location of the wound. Don't attempt to close it yourself—seek professional evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take for surgical incisions to heal?",
      "answer": "Healing timelines vary by surgery type, location, and individual factors. Superficial wounds may heal within 1-2 weeks. Deeper incisions take 2-3 weeks for initial healing, but full tissue strength doesn't return for months. Sutures or staples are typically removed 7-14 days after surgery, but this doesn't mean the wound is fully healed. Tensile strength continues to increase for up to a year after surgery. Factors that slow healing include diabetes, poor circulation, smoking, malnutrition, infection, and certain medications. Follow up with your surgeon to ensure healing is progressing appropriately."
