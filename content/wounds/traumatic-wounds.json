      "content": "Traumatic wounds are injuries caused by external physical force or violence to the body. These include cuts, scrapes, punctures, and crush injuries that happen during accidents, falls, sports activities, or other unexpected events.\n\nMost traumatic wounds are acute injuries that heal normally within a predictable timeframe (days to weeks). However, some traumatic wounds can become chronic non-healing wounds due to complications like infection, poor blood supply, underlying health conditions, or improper initial treatment. Understanding the difference helps you know when simple home care is enough versus when professional medical attention is critical.",

    {
      "question": "How do I know if my wound needs stitches?",
      "answer": "Seek stitches if: wound edges gape open and don't stay together, wound is deeper than ¼ inch, you can see fat/muscle/bone, wound is on the face (for best cosmetic result), bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure, wound is over a joint, or it's longer than ½ inch. The golden window for stitching is within 6-8 hours of injury for best results and lowest infection risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I remove a small embedded object myself, like a splinter or glass?",
      "answer": "Small, superficial splinters close to the surface can usually be removed at home with clean tweezers. However, seek medical care for: deep embedded objects, glass shards (can break into smaller pieces), objects embedded in eye or face, metal fragments, anything near blood vessels or tendons, objects you can't fully remove, or if the area shows signs of infection. Never try to remove large or deeply embedded objects—this can cause severe bleeding or further damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "My cut is healing but has a hard, crusty scab. Should I remove it?",
      "answer": "No. Leave scabs alone—they're nature's bandage. Scabs protect the healing tissue underneath and prevent infection. Picking at scabs can: introduce bacteria, damage new tissue forming underneath, cause bleeding, delay healing, and increase scarring. Keep the area clean and covered. The scab will fall off naturally when the skin underneath has healed. If the scab becomes very thick, foul-smelling, or has increasing redness around it, see your provider—this may indicate infection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long is too long for a wound to still be healing?",
      "answer": "General timeline: small cuts/scrapes should show significant improvement in 7-10 days and be healed in 2-3 weeks. Larger or deeper wounds may take 3-6 weeks. If your wound shows NO improvement after 2 weeks of proper care, is getting worse, or isn't completely healed after 4-6 weeks, seek medical evaluation. People with diabetes, circulation problems, or immune compromise should see a provider sooner—don't wait to get evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between normal healing and infection?",
      "answer": "Normal healing: mild redness right around wound edges, decreasing pain, clear or slightly bloody drainage, wound getting smaller. Infection warning signs: redness spreading beyond wound, increasing pain (especially throbbing), warmth, swelling, pus (thick, cloudy, yellow/green drainage), foul odor, red streaks moving up limb, fever. If you see infection signs, don't wait—seek medical care promptly. Early treatment prevents serious complications."
